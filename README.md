### Hi there 👋

My name is Tiago. I practice operative Hermeticism through music, graphics, code, and poetry.
At the core of my work lies the creation of artworks that embody my vision of operative black and white magick—most often expressed as absurd, playful music for viola and live electronics. In essence, I perform magick through sound: transmuting light into darkness and darkness into light. This is simultaneously goetic and theurgic, a deliberate dance along the entire spectrum of the Tree of Life and the Tree of Death.
I also walk the path of Thelema and invoke the highest forms of white magick, not to banish shadow but to emanate light so intensely that it casts shade—revealing nuance where others see only opposites.
Hermetic orders, secret societies, occult elite circles, or Scientology-style hierarchies? Entirely unnecessary. True initiation today requires no lodge room, no passwords, no dues.
All that is needed is:

- SAP consultancy and automation scripts running in the background like faithful familiars
- a Telekom Mobile SIM card keeping the sigils connected 24/7
- the infinite library of the internet
- books on esotericism (physical or digital)
- podcasts that whisper while I code
- and music—always music

That is the only temple I recognize. That is the only hierarchy I serve.
