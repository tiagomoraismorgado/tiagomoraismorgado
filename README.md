### Hi there 👋

my name is tiago. i practice operative hermeticism throughout music, graphics, code, and poetry.
my main goal with that is doing artworks that represent my vision of operative satanism,
focusing mostly in doing silly music with viola and live electronics.
putting it together, i do black magick with music, in order to turn light into darkness, 
and darkness into light. that means, i also practice theurgy, and white magick.
hermetic orders and secret societies? no one needs that.
read books on esotericism, listen to podcasts, and listen to music. no one needs more then that
